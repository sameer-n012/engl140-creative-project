For this project, I attempted to create a short collection of journal entries by Raymond Rambert, set in the city of Oran, Algeria during the events of Albert Camus' novel, The Plague. I tried to convey Rambert's initial desperation to leave the city to reunite with his wife and his lack of understanding of the senseless nature of the plague in the city. As the novel progresses, he comes into conflict with Tarrou and Rieux's philosophy of what should be a human response to great suffering and his own desire to live for himself, before finally understanding their perspective and working to help Dr. Rieux. As he is reunited with his wife at the end of the story, it is shown how his worldview has been fundamentally changed by the plague.
