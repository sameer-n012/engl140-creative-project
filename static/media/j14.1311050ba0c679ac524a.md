At last, as the new year passes, the gates of the city are finally opened and trains from across the world are allowed in. I had received word from my wife earlier that she would be coming immediately, and as such, rushed to the train station to meet her. As excited as I was, I was mostly nervous about seeing her again; I would be seeing the person I had been yearning for all this time and confronting the love that had tormented me these past months. If only I could be the man whom I was before the plague who only had one desire: to escape and return to the woman I loved. However, the plague has changed me too greatly, broadening my view of the world and my sense of duty to it. Although I still love her, I can no longer view her, and love, as the sole purpose of my life. Yet I am thankful that I had not been permanently separated from her as Dr. Rieux had been from his wife, and I plan to make the most of our future together.
