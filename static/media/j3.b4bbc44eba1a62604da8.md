A drastic development has taken place: M. Michel has suddenly passed away from sickness. Dr. Rieux had seen him a couple of days ago, but just today the town received news that he passed away. Before he died, he was experiencing a strong fever and boils across his entire body and spent much of the night vomiting. Those who spent the night with him told me that he talked about rats and the rat infestation across the city several times, trying to convey something seemingly urgent to Dr. Rieux. In the morning, the doctor called an ambulance for M. Michel, but he, unfortunately, passed away on the way to the hospital.

I never thought that being this far from my wife in Paris would affect me so greatly, yet I often find myself thinking about her and our life together. I have become desperate to see her again and I can't wait until my assignment here is over so that I can finally leave Oran for my home.
