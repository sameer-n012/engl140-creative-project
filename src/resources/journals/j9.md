Tarrou revealed to me that Dr. Rieux has a wife who is currently outside the city. At once, I suddenly feel guilty for thinking of my own escape when there are so many others like me who are stuck inside the city, unable to see their loved ones. Although I do not understand Rieux's remarks about his sense of duty, I agreed to help him and Tarrou in fighting the plague, at least until I am allowed to leave the city.
