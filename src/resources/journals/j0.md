I arrived in the small city of Oran yesterday, only to despair at the drastic difference from my home in Paris. Here, the air felt constantly hot and dry, making the town stale and lifeless. There are few gardens or greenery, and nothing much ever happens of interest. Moreover, the air of this town feels constantly suffocating and there is none of the liveliness that accompanies late nights out in Paris or summer strolls along the Seine. The residents do not spend much time engaging in enjoyable activies, and instead spend their entire week on the pursuit of making money. I can only hope to finish my reporting assignment in the city and return to my wife in Paris as soon as I can.
