Over the past several weeks, more and more people have become sick and died in the city. Some of the residents are becoming more worried as this mysterious illness sweeps through the population. The government has also started to put up notices and announcements in the local newspapers about the sickness, although most officials still say that it is not contagious and that there is no need to panic. Some of the residents have taken their advice to heart, such as a local hotel manager who insisted on keeping his hotel open for customers through these times. On the other hand, Dr. Rieux appears to be taking this illness very seriously and has started studying the symptoms of each of his patients. 

And there's also Jean Tarrou, a man I met in the hotel a few days ago. To me, Tarrou is a complete enigma. He seems to be taking the whole situation in stride and doing what he can to help those around him. I can't help but feel a sense of admiration for him,  as I contrast his actions to my own feelings of hopelessness and desire to leave the city.
