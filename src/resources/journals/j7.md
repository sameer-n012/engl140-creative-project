I can no longer tolerate living in this city anymore. The only option I see is to sneak out of the city against the ruling of the government. To that end, I have found a remarkable man by the name of Cottard who may be able to help me. He seems to know everything and everyone in the city and has promised me a way out for a price. Although he might engage in some unsavory practices on the side, I have no choice if I want to return to Paris and reunite with those I love. I will meet with him tomorrow and see if he can help me. Cottard has put me in touch with several others: Raoul, Gonzales, Garcia, Marcel, and Louis who may be able to help me.

Before leaving, I spoke again to Dr. Rieux about the plague. Although I feel guilty for leaving the city in such a state when no one else can do so, I must follow my heart and return to Paris.
