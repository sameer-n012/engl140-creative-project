A few days after Christmas, we had the first week in almost a year where the weekly deaths have gone down. The relief in the air and among the population is palpable, and there is a general optimism that the plague will be over soon. Even Dr. Rieux and Tarrou seem far more relaxed with less work to do. The only person who seems angry about the dissapearence of the plague is Cottard, who has been appearing more and more paranoid as the days pass by. Soon the quarantine on the city will be lifted and I can finally be reunited with my wife after all these months. 

Unfortunately, as the plague came to an end, perhaps the most grevious of deaths happened. Tarrou was inflicted with boils, coughing, and a fever and had to be sent to Dr. Rieux for treatment. Although he promised that he would recover from this, he eventually passed away later that night. Dr. Rieux was devastated by this and grieved openly for the loss of his friend. Moreover, Dr. Rieux received a letter from the sanitorium informing him of his wife's passing.
