Over the past week, a curious phenomenon has struck the town: rats, either dying or dead, have started to appear all across the streets. I even found one in my own bedroom, though I have no clue as to how it got there. These rats often are found bleeding from their mouths and convulsing as they die, creating an bigger problem in cleaning them up. Wherever residents walk, dead rats litter the pathways turning a once-boring town into one of the most disgusting and unsanitary places I have traveled to. There are more rats now on the streets of Oran than I ever thought existed in the city, contributing to my (and many others') disbelief of the situation at hand.

However, the appearance of the rats has given the townspeople something to talk about different than the usual discussion regarding business endeavors, and most people around the town seem rather excited by the new development. Of the people I have spoken to so far, no one has been concerned by the rats. Indeed, there are many residents, calling themselves amateur scientists, hoarding and examining the lifeless rats in an attempt to find some explanation behind this phenomenon.

Tomorrow, I plan to speak to the esteemed Dr. Bernard Rieux about the living conditions of the Arab population in the city, to be published by my employer in Paris. This was my original purpose for coming to Oran, and I am eager to finally be able to speak to the doctor about the situation.
