I have at last been able to speak to Dr. Rieux and ask him whether the citizens of France should be concerned about the sanitary conditions of Arabic people in Oran. I found the doctor to be a most interesting individual. Before giving me any statement about the question, he inquired about whether I would be able to only report on what he said in an unqualified manner. Of course, as a journalist, I could not agree to this request as I wished to interview several other people as well about it. Due to this, I was, unfortunately, unable to get any information from the doctor. Of course, I cannot blame the doctor for this, and overall I found Dr. Rieux to be quite a principled man, and indeed, he suggested that I write instead about the rats that have been appearing in the streets.
