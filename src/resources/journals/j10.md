It has now been months since the start of the plague, and there is no sign that it will go away any time soon. The residents of Oran are as restless as I am, except they have taken to violence as the solution. Several houses, some just two blocks from mine, have been burned down in an attempt to exterminate the plague, and groups of protestors and rioters have been at the town gates for days asking to leave the city. Because so many people are dying, the bodies are being cremated instead of buried causing the air to always be thick with smoke. I feel oppressed and imprisoned by the poisonous air just as the plague imprisons us in the city. 

I finally met with Marcel and Louis again yesterday to try and escape the city. They invited me to spend the night in their mother's house, a bright little house in the Spanish style close to the dockyards. They had somehow procured rice, which had been unavailable for quite some time, and the dinner that night was delicious. Unfortunately, I would have to wait another two weeks to try to leave the town.
