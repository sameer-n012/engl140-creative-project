I have at last decided to permanently stay in the town until the plague abates after seeing the work that Dr. Rieux and Tarrou are doing for the residents. Although I would be sacrificing my happiness and time with my wife in Paris, I feel that I have a duty to help the people of Oran in their struggle, and I finally understand what Dr. Rieux meant when he said that there is no heroism, only common decency in fighting the plague. 

I have heard from Dr. Rieux that another doctor, Dr. Castel, has come close to finishing the antidote to this illness. Hopefully, the the plague will be over soon and those that are sick can be cured to relieve us all from this terrible horror. 

Visiting a quarantine camp in the football stadium in the city felt like a worse version of the prison we have all been subjected to over the past months. Everyone was sick and dying, and the only thing they could do was wait for their fate in despair. There was little talk in the camp, the residents had mostly given up on their lives and grasped the uncaring sentiment of the rest of the city towards them. Here and there, occupants had been marking the number of days that had passed without anything to do. With me came Gonzales. In the camp, we found M. Othon, a police magistrate in the city who had heard about his son's death.
