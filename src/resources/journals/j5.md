In the last two days, the number of deaths from this illness has increased dramatically and many of the residents are trying the leave the city. Those who cannot are wary of interacting with anyone else, as they fear that they may be infected. The streets are becoming more and more empty as people become more reclusive and the plague takes away any human connections the residents of this town once had. The authorities finally decided to quarantine Oran, not letting anyone into or out of the city, causing even more turmoil among the population.

I came to Oran with a purpose: to write a story about the conditions of Arabic life in Algeria under the French. But now, with this illness spreading across the town, that purpose seems trivial and insignificant. I become more and more desperate to leave this place and return to Paris to my wife, despite the possibility of me returning slowly diminishing as the plague spreads.
