Unfortunately, my attempt to leave the city did not go as planned. On the night I was scheduled to leave, I was unable to find Gonzales and had to delay the attempt. I attempted to contact Cottard once more, but he suggested that the process would again take weeks to complete further depressing my spirit.

Moreover, Tarrou and Dr. Rieux keep mentioning that I should stay in the city and help them with the plague. I don't understand why they are so insistent on me staying in the city when it seems so hopeless. I once (and still do) believed that there is no heroism in life, and that the only thing someone can do is follow their heart. However, Dr. Rieux seems convinced that there is no heroism in fighting the plague, merely a sense of duty as a human.
